## Further Reading

While working on this book, I will add more texts here than may end up in the final draft. The standard for a text being added here is that I spent at least a few minutes looking over a text to determine if there is material that is related to what I would like to cover in my book and that looks useful for helping me to understand or think about concepts differently.
